# High Utility Sequential Pattern Hiding
Multi-core parallel algorithms for hiding high-utility sequential patterns

# How To Run
- Modify the bin/run.bat at your criteria
- Execute run.bat

# Repository Structure
1. bin
  - run.bat
  - USH.exe: built binary executable file
2. data: dir of datasets
3. sanitized: dir where sanitized dataset is written to here
4. hiding-out.txt: hiding results
5. mining-out.txt: mining results
6. hiding-random-out.txt: hinding PF results, when run USHP or USHR with upsilon > 0
